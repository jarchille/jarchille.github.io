The key take-away from this project was that sketching out a projects dimension and scope ahead of time is a huge time-saver. Thinking I could tackle it all at once and figure it out as I went turned out not to be the most effective strategy. Also, I was reminded of how wildly inaccurate one's sense of a project timeline can be. Maybe I wasn't fully appreciating how much of a novice I still am, ha!.  Hopefully I'll be a better judge of time requirements in the future.  Turns out you always think you have more time than you really do.  That said, however, I must say there is a real sense of satisfaction that comes when an idea transforms from a mere concept to real-life product.  And there's an even bigger high when a product shifts from "good" to "really good" to "great". Those last couple yards though, traversing the gap between a quality product and an exceptional product, is definitely the hardest.  The fact is, anyone with some technical skill can great a good product but apps that really differentiate themselves have teams (or individuals) behnd them that have gone the extra mile in order to create a really good and highly polished app. Releasing a quality app that improves someone's life is worth it, I think. Now, having had just a small taste of the rigors of the process, I have a newfound appreciation for the hours and hours of hard work that go into producing an app from scratch. Making great stuff that has an impact might be what I most look forward to when I begin working in development full-time. So, more than anything, I think this project has validated my sense of why app development fascinates me!
